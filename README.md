### What's new?

- Updated the Tree Indent Lines
- Few minor changes to the terminal
- Changed colour for Active Tabs.
- We are hearing you'll, do let us know for any changes..!!

I seriously, don't know how I came up with this theme.
Bascially it's a combination of Deadpool + Spiderman + Iron Man + Iconic Batman dialogue 'Do you Bleed?'

**Extension for the HardCore Coders**

Finally made my dream theme. Red is like my Beast Color Palette.
The Pallete consists of :-

- #eeebdd
- #ce1212
- #810000
- #1b1717
- #ffe268
- #ffb037
- #feff89
